# ClaimDonation is (C) Copyright Noah Hollowell and may be redistributed but NOT SOLD!
# %player% and %command% are placeholders and can only be used in SUBCMD_INCORRECT and PLAYER_OFFLINE
# If you translate the config into another language (all of this bit and below) please can you send me a copie so I can support other languages! 
# Best to message me on Spigot or leave a comment on the plugins page saying that you have done this!
#
# About the 'players:' section
# Players will always be empty apart from during a server restart! It will store any donations that have not been claimed before a restart and will save them here and then load them into the plugin and then clear this section!
# Claimed item data will not be saved upon a crash! I am working on a way around this!
#
# PLACEHOLDERS CAN ONLY BE USED IN CERTAIN MESSAGES:
# %player%: PLAYER_OFFLINE, PLAYER_COMMAND_LIST, PLAYER_COMMAND_LIST_HEADER, REMOVE_COMMAND_NONUMBER, COMMAND_REMOVED
# %command%: SUBCMD_INCORRECT, PLAYER_COMMAND_LIST, COMMAND_REMOVED
# %cmdnumber%: CAN ONLY BE USED IN: PLAYER_COMMAND_LIST
#
# COLORS SECTION:
# Specifiying colors here will change the colors for the GUI Name. 1, 2, 3 & 4 associated themselves with each parth of the sentence!
# 1 = "Donation", 2 = "Claim" , etc
# Setting these using ESSENTIALS Color codes (& symbol)  will change the color of each word of the inventory menu ingame!
#
# Player data is now saved in data.yml, it is recommended that you do not change anything in there as you could break someones donations! Only change things if you know what your doing!
#
# Please do not edit the value of firstRun! It is there to ensure messages are loaded the first time the plugin is ran!
