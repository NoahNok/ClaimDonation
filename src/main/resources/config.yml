# ClaimDonation is (C) Copyright Noah Hollowell and may be redistributed but NOT SOLD!
# %player% and %command% are placeholders and can only be used in SUBCMD_INCORRECT and PLAYER_OFFLINE
# If you translate the config into another language (all of this bit and below) please can you send me a copie so I can support other languages! 
# Best to message me on Spigot or leave a comment on the plugins page saying that you have done this!
#
# About the 'players:' section
# Players will always be empty apart from during a server restart! It will store any donations that have not been claimed before a restart and will save them here and then load them into the plugin and then clear this section!
# Claimed item data will not be saved upon a crash! I am working on a way around this!
#
# PLACEHOLDERS CAN ONLY BE USED IN CERTAIN MESSAGES:
# %player%: PLAYER_OFFLINE, PLAYER_COMMAND_LIST, PLAYER_COMMAND_LIST_HEADER, REMOVE_COMMAND_NONUMBER, COMMAND_REMOVED
# %command%: SUBCMD_INCORRECT, PLAYER_COMMAND_LIST, COMMAND_REMOVED
# %cmdnumber%: CAN ONLY BE USED IN: PLAYER_COMMAND_LIST
#
# UPDATE: 1.2.0 - REMOVE COMMAND ADDED, MESSAGES HAVE BEEN OPTIMISED TO BE LOADED AT THE START AND ON RELOADS AND NOT ACCESSED FROM THE FILE EVERY TIME!
# NEW MESSAGES, NEW PLACEHOLDER! %cmdnumber%
